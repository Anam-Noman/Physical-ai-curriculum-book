# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation and Deployment Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All technical claims must be correct and verified against reliable sources

### Clarity
Content must be understandable to a technical audience with basic CS knowledge

### Spec-driven rigor
Follow Spec-Kit Plus structure strictly for consistency and traceability

### Reproducibility
Instructions, configs, and examples must be repeatable by readers

### Transparency
Clearly distinguish facts, assumptions, and examples

### Code Quality
All code examples must be syntactically correct and runnable

## Key Standards

- All factual or technical claims must be supported by sources or official documentation
- Citation format: APA style (inline where applicable, references section at end)
- Source types: Official docs, peer-reviewed articles, and reputable technical blogs
- Plagiarism tolerance: 0% (all content must be original or properly cited)
- Code quality: All code examples must be syntactically correct and runnable
- Documentation style: Docusaurus-compatible MD/MDX only

## Constraints and Success Criteria

- Structure must follow Spec-Kit Plus sections and conventions
- Each chapter must have a clear objective and summary
- Content must build incrementally from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Deployment instructions must work on GitHub Pages without modification
- Book builds successfully with Docusaurus (no build or MDX errors)
- GitHub Pages deployment works correctly
- All claims are traceable and verifiable
- Code examples run without errors
- Content is clear, consistent, and technically accurate

## Governance

All contributions must adhere to these principles. Deviations require explicit approval from core maintainers. Any changes to the book content must undergo review to ensure compliance with these principles before merging into the main branch. The constitution can only be amended through a formal proposal and approval process.
