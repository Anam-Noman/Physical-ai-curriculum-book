# Create Physical AI Book Tasks

## Prompt Text

```

```

## Response Text

Generated a comprehensive tasks.md file for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book project based on available design artifacts. The tasks are organized into 9 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Master Physical AI Principles and ROS 2 (P1)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Master Digital Twin Simulation (P2)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Develop AI-Robot Cognitive Systems (P3)
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Integrate Vision-Language-Action Systems (P4)
7. Phase 7: Capstone Project Implementation
8. Phase 8: References and Citations
9. Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

The tasks follow the required checklist format with Task IDs (T001-T086), parallel markers [P] where appropriate, and user story labels [US1-US4] for phase-specific tasks. All content is structured for Docusaurus as the frontend, with proper file paths for documentation, components, and configuration files.

The task list includes dependencies, parallel execution opportunities, and implementation strategies as specified. Each user story is designed to be independently implementable and testable.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed, dependency-ordered task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Technical Book project. The tasks are organized by user story priority and include proper file paths for Docusaurus-based documentation. The structure allows for both sequential and parallel execution depending on team capacity.
