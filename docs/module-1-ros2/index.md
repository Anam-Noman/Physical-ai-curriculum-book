# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics curriculum. This module focuses on the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" that connects the digital brain to the physical body of robots. You'll learn how ROS 2 enables communication and coordination between different components of a robotic system.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module (Weeks 1-5), you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI systems
- Describe the architecture of ROS 2 and how it differs from earlier versions
- Implement basic communication patterns using Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
- Bridge Python AI agents to robot controllers using the rclpy library
- Model humanoid robots using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)

### Module Structure

This module is organized across Weeks 1-5 with specific learning objectives for each period:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Introduction to Physical AI Foundations
  - Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
  - From digital AI to robots that obey physical laws
  - Overview of humanoid robotics systems
  - Sensor systems: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

- **Weeks 3-5**: ROS 2 Fundamentals
  - ROS 2 architecture and design philosophy
  - Nodes, Topics, Services, and Actions
  - Building ROS 2 packages with Python
  - Launch files and parameter management

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Completed the environment setup as outlined in the introduction

### Assessment

At the end of this module, you'll complete an assessment that includes:
- A practical project implementing a basic ROS 2 system
- A demonstration showing how a Python AI agent controls a simulated humanoid robot
- An explanation of Physical AI and embodied intelligence concepts
