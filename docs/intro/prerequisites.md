# Prerequisites

To successfully complete this Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics curriculum, you'll need to prepare your development environment and ensure you have the necessary background knowledge.

## Background Knowledge

### Essential Skills
- **Python Programming**: Proficiency in Python 3.x, including understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- **Basic AI/ML Concepts**: Understanding of machine learning fundamentals, neural networks, and data processing
- **Mathematics**: Familiarity with linear algebra (vectors, matrices) and control theory fundamentals
- **Command Line**: Comfortable using terminal/command prompt for development tasks

### Recommended Background
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (kinematics, sensors, actuators)
- Experience with version control (Git)
- Familiarity with Linux environments (Ubuntu preferred)

## Hardware Requirements

### Minimum Specifications
- **Processor**: Multi-core processor (Intel i5 or equivalent AMD)
- **Memory**: 16GB RAM minimum (32GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 50GB free disk space
- **Graphics**: GPU with CUDA support (NVIDIA GPU preferred for Isaac Sim)

### Recommended Specifications
- **Processor**: Intel i7 or equivalent AMD Ryzen 7
- **Memory**: 32GB RAM
- **Storage**: SSD with 100GB+ free space
- **Graphics**: NVIDIA RTX series GPU with 8GB+ VRAM

## Software Installation

### Required Software
1. **Git**: Version control system
2. **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (for Docusaurus documentation)
3. **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher
4. **Docker**: For containerized simulation environments (optional but recommended)

### Development Environment
You can choose between different development approaches:
- **Local Installation**: Install all tools directly on your machine
- **Containerized Environment**: Use Docker for isolated environments
- **Cloud Development**: Use cloud-based development environments

### Simulation Platforms (Optional)
While we'll primarily focus on simulation for learning, you may want to install:
- **Gazebo**: Physics simulation environment
- **Unity**: For visualization (Unity 2023.2 LTS)
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: For advanced simulation and perception (requires NVIDIA GPU)

## Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Verify Python (3.8+) installation: `python --version`
- [ ] Verify Node.js (18+) installation: `node --version`
- [ ] Install Git: `git --version`
- [ ] Ensure you have 16GB+ RAM available
- [ ] Create a dedicated workspace directory for the curriculum

## Next Steps

Once you have these prerequisites met, proceed to the [Environment Setup](./setup.md) guide to configure your development environment specifically for this curriculum.
